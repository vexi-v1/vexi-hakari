# Prompt log

Times are JST. Each entry: the prompt as given (or a faithful summary when it was long),
and what the AI produced from it.

## 2026-09-25 21:20 — H0, the spec

Prompt: the full spec in `2026-09-25-spec-zh.md`, followed by the Uniswap Foundation and
1inch prize pages pasted from ETHGlobal, and:

> 中間除非遇到問題，不然不要停下來問我，直接幫我做完，不用分Eric or Abner
> ("Unless you hit a problem, don't stop to ask me — do the whole thing; don't split it
> between Eric and Abner.")

Decisions recorded in the prompt: name is HAKARI; Curvegrid is skipped; mentioning our own
protocol (Vexi) as the source of the atomic-push measurement is fine.

Output: repo skeleton (LICENSE, AGENTS.md, FEEDBACK.md, SPEC.md, this log), pinned
libraries, then the contracts in the order of SPEC.md § 7.

## 2026-09-25 21:50 — .env

> 幫我新建.env and .env.example, 然後我把 RH_TESTNET_RPC / RH_MAINNET_RPC 貼進去
> ("Create .env and .env.example; I'll paste RH_TESTNET_RPC / RH_MAINNET_RPC in.")

Output: `.env.example` (public RPC defaults, `HAKARI_DEPLOYER_KEY` empty), `.env` git-ignored and
never read by the AI.
